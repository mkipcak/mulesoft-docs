= Client ID Enforcement
:imagesdir: ./_images

The Client ID Enforcement policy checks that all requests are made by a valid client application.
This policy allows only link:/api-manager/v/2.x/api-contracts-landing-page[Authorized Applications] to access the deployed API implementation.
Each application that would like to access said API must configured with credentials: client ID and Secret.

At runtime, applications must provide credentials with each request to the API implementation.
The credentials obtained from the request are compared with the authorized client applications.
If the credentials are valid, the policy grants access to the deployed API implementation, otherwise, the policy denies access returning a HTTP status code of 401 Unauthorized.

As Authorized credential data is obtained from API Manager, each Mule Runtime keeps a persistent cache, which updates periodically.
This cache is useful for performance, and in the event of a sudden loss of connectivity to the platform.
The enforcement is applied regardless of the state of the management plane.

== Configuring Client Id Enforcement Policy

image::ApplyClientIdEnforcement.png[]

The client ID Enforcement Policy configuration is for indicating the runtime where to obtain the credentials from.
If the option *HTTP Basic Authentication Header* is set, it will look for the credentials in the _Authentication_ header;
If *Custom Expression* is set, you can provide an expression for obtaining the client id and secret.

*Mule Runtime 3.x*

* Client ID Expression: MEL expression for the client ID.
* Client Secret Expression: MEL expression for the client Secret.

*Mule Runtime 4.x*

* Client ID Expression: DataWeave 2.0 expression for the client ID.
* Client Secret Expression: DataWeave 2.0 expression for the client Secret.

If the Client Secret Expression is left empty the policy will only verify the client ID and ignore the client Secret.
